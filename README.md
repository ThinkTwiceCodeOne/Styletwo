# Styletwo
As you see in styleone we used a very old technique and very irritating technique. To get rid of PrintWriter. I'm doing a project named as styletwo in which I introduces concept of JSP, JavaBeans, JSP Tags.
In this project, I introduce the concept of Authentication also. It's not complete totally. Lots of features will be added soon
